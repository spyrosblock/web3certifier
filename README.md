# Web3 Certifier

## About
Web3 Certifier is an open-source certification platform which offers exams for the verification of someone's knowledge in a wide range of subjects.

## How it works
Web3 Certifier is based on Blockchain technology, and all the data involved in the certification process is stored on-chain.

## AI Agent

## How to run this repository
### To run the AI Agent:
1. Go to the `packages/agent` directory and create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file.
2. From the root directory execute the command: 
   - `yarn install`
3. Then from the `packages/agent` directory execute the commands:
   - `pnpm i`
   - `pnpm build`
   - `pnpm start`

### To run the front-end:
1. Go to the `packages/nextjs` directory and create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file.
2. From the root directory execute the commands: 
   - `yarn install`
   - `yarn start`

### To deploy the smart contract:
1. Go to the `packages/foundry` directory and create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file.
2. From the `packages/foundry` directory execute the commands: 
   - `yarn deploy --network sepolia`
   - `yarn verify --network sepolia` or `forge verify-contract 0x8c008619305dC27009d0c81E204C30F7c9726E9B contracts/Certifier.sol:Certifier --compiler-version "0.8.24+commit.e11b9ed9" --chain 42161 --constructor-args 0x000000000000000000000000694aa1769357215de4fac081bf1f309adc325306 --watch --etherscan-api-key <key>`
3. For deployments you need to change the "DEPLOY_CONTRACT", "UPGRADE_CERTIFIER_CONTRACT", "UPGRADE_REWARD_FACTORY_CONTRACT" and the proxy addresses in the .env file.
4. To verify the reward contract do: `make deploy-reward-{network}`. Look at Makefile!

### To redeploy the subgraph:
Delete the `packages/the-graph` directory and go to <a href="https://thegraph.com/studio/">https://thegraph.com/studio/</a>. There you can follow the instructions to create a new subgraph. Use the implementation contract and then change the 'address' and the 'startblock' at the subgraph.yaml file to the proxy contract address and startblock. Then execute 'graph deploy certifier-celo'.

### To see file sizes:
Run: `ANALYZE=true npm run build` from the packages/nextjs directory.
